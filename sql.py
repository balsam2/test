"""
The city of New York does restaurant inspections and assigns a grade.  Inspections data the last 4 years are available [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/thedataincubator/coursedata/nyc_inspection_data.zip).

The file `RI_Webextract_BigApps_Latest.xls` contains a description of each of the datafiles.  Take a look and then load the csv formatted `*.txt` files into Postgresql into five tables:
1. `actions`
2. `cuisines`
3. `violations`
4. `grades` (from `WebExtract.txt`)
5. `boroughs` (from `RI_Webextract_BigApps_Latest.xls`)

**Hints:**
1. Postgresql has a [`\copy` command](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMANDS-COPY) that can both save and load files in various formats.  It is a convenience wrapper for the [`copy` command](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/sql-copy.html) but behaves better (e.g. relative paths).

2. The files may contain malformatted text.  Unfortunately, this is all too common.  As a stop gap, remember that `iconv` is a unix utility that can convert files between different text encodings.

3. For more sophisticated needs, a good strategy is to write simple python scripts that will reparse files.  For example, commas (',') within a single field will trick many csv parsers into breaking up the field.  Write a python script that converts these 'inadvertent' delimiters into semicolons (';').

class ViolationByCuisine(TupleListValidateMixin, Question):
  """
  Which cuisines tend to have a disproportionate number of what which violations?  Answering this question isn't easy becuase you have to think carefully about normalizations.

  1. More popular cuisine categories will tend to have more violations just becuase they represent more restaurants.

  2. Similarly, some violations are more common.  For example, knowing that "Equipment not easily movable or sealed to floor" is a common violation for Chinese restuarants is not particularly helpful when it is a common violation for all restaurants.

  The right quantity is to look at is the conditional probability of a specific type of violation given a specific cuisine type and divide it by the unconditional probability of the violation for the entire population.  Taking this ratio gives the right answer.  Return the 20 highest ratios.

  **Hint**:
  1. You might want to check out this [Stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/972877/calculate-frequency-using-sql).

  2. The definition of a violation changes with time.  For example, 10A can mean two different things "Toilet facility not maintained ..." or "Vermin or other live animal present ..." when things were prior to 2003.

  3. The ratios don't mean much when the number of violations of a given type and for a specific category are not large (why not?).  Be sure to filter these out.  We chose 100 as our cutoff.
